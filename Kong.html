            <p style="font-size: x-large;">King Kong (キングコング Kingu Kongu?), also dubbed Titanus Kong or simply Kong, is the deuteragonist of the MonsterVerse franchise. He is a giant gorilla like-ape Titan who lived on Skull Island with a group of humans who worshiped him as a god, as he and his ancestors protected them from the island's many dangers, especially the predatory Skullcrawlers.

                He, as an adolescent, first appeared as the main protagonist of the 2017 epic monster action-adventure film Kong: Skull Island, and a cameo character in the 2019 film Godzilla: King of the Monsters. He reappears in the 2021 film Godzilla vs. Kong as one of the two main protagonists (alongside Godzilla) in which he, as an adult, battles both Godzilla and later team up with his to destroy Mechagodzilla. He later returns in the 2023 animated TV series Skull Island, which takes place in the 1993 during his life on Skull Island. He is set to appear in the 2024 sequel, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.
                
                In Kong: Skull Island, he was portrayed by Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell in motion-capture. In Godzilla vs Kong, he is portrayed by Eric Petey also in motion-capture.

                Appearances
                In 1944, during the Pacific theatre of World War II, Kong first appears rising over a ledge where U.S. Air Force pilot Hank Marlow and and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari were fighting.

In 1973, after Preston Packard and his military squadron drop seismic bomb charges on the land below to map it. Enraged, Kong attacks the helicopters, swatting them out of the air and killing many of Packard's men, to which Packard swears vengeance against Kong. Following the conflict, Kong reappears at a lake, heavily wounded from the earlier fight. As he washes his wounds and drinks from the lake, a Mire Squid attacks Kong, but he manages to kill the creature by stomping on its head and proceeds to make a meal of the giant cephalopod.

Later, Kong is seen jumping from one mountain to another as he looks over the island. Kong finds a dead Sker Buffalo being eaten by a Skullcrawler near a large underground vent. As he is about to engage the creature, another one ambushes Kong from behind. He kills them by throwing one to the ground, breaking its neck, and stomping the other's head. Some time later, Mason Weaver tries and fails to save a Sker Buffalo trapped under a downed helicopter outside the Iwi village. Kong appears and rescues the buffalo. He encounters Weaver for the first time and looks at her curiously before leaving her be. Later that night, he is seen sitting atop a mountain, somberly watching the aurora.
